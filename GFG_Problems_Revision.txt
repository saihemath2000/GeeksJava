NOTE:
*. (x &~(x-1)) ---> It finds a no which has only one bit set and bit corresponds to last set bit of x
*. (1<<n) --->2^n, (n>>1)--->n/2
*. Swap two numbers using xor  
   a^=b
   b^=a 
   a^=b

a) MATHEMATICS

Trailing zeros in factorial
GCD
Prime
Prime Factors
Prime numbers upto n (Sieve of Eratosthenes)
Computing power(x^n)

b) BIT LOGIC
Check if kth bit is set (1<<(k-1))
Count set bits of n    (while n>0: n=n&(n-1),res+=1)
Power of 2 (n&(n-1)==0---> true)
One odd occuring (res=res ^ arr[i])--> xor
Power set of a string("abc"....)

c) RECURSION
Palindrome recursive (return (str.charAt(start)==str.charAt(end))&& palindrome(str,start+1,end-1));
All subsets of a string/powerset
Josephus problem (jos(n-1,k)+k)%n
Count subsets for given sum (sum=25,[10,15,20])
Permutations of a string (maintain index of fixed position , along with a loop,swap)

d) ARRAYS
Finding second largest element (keep track of largest element )
Remove duplicates from an unsorted array in O(1) space
Left rotate an array by d places (recursion, reverse first d places, next d to n places and reverse total array)
Trapping water (finding lmax, rmax and finding min between corresponding values-arr[i])
Maxsumsubarray (finding max sum)
Maxcircular subarray sum
Sliding window technique
Find subarray with given sum

e) SEARCHING
Index of first occurence
Index of last occcurence
Count occurences of an element (lasto-firsto+1)
Count 1's in a sorted binary tree
Square root
Search in a sorted rotated array
Find a peak element(Both adjacent elements are smaller)
Triplet sum (sorted array)
Median of two sorted arrays
Repeating element (slow,fast approach)
Allocate min no pages (ans in [Maxelement,Sum], binary search)


d) SORTING
Sorting non primitive types (cmp fucntion implements Comparator<Point>, Point)
Bubble sort
Insertion sort
Selection sort
Merge sort
Intersection of two sorted arrays
Union of two sorted arrays
lomuto partition
hoarse partition
kthsmallest element(using lomuto partition)
dutch national flag problem (seggregate 0's 1's and 2's)
Merge overlapping intervals
Cycle sort
Heap sort
Count sort
Radix sort
